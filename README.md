# trianglify-demo
This is a simple web page to demo Trianglify; a JS library that generates cool backgrounds. I'm currently using a Trianglify generated background in my [website](http://www.oscarparamo.com) and wanted a simple way to generate more custom backgrounds. More information about Trinaglify can be found [here](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify).

This demo depends on Trianglify. If you have npm installed, you can run `npm install` in the project directory. Alternatively, you can go [here](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify) and get Trianglify a variety of ways. To use the demo, open the 'trianglify.html' file in a web browser. Open the same file in a text editor to play with the different options.
